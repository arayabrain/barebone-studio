OptiNiSt - Calcium Imaging Pipeline Tool
==========================================

**OptiNiSt(Optical Neuroimage Studio)** helps researchers try multiple data analysis methods, visualize the results, and construct the data analysis pipelines easily and quickly. OptiNiSt's data-saving format follows NWB standards.

OptiNiSt also supports reproducibility of scientific research, standardization of analysis protocols, and developments of novel analysis tools as plug-in.


Main Features
--------------
- **Easy-To-Create Workflow**: allows you to create analysis pipelines easily on the GUI.
- **Visualizing analysis results**: supports you visualize the analysis results.
- **Managing Workflows**: records and reproduces the workflow pipelines easily.
