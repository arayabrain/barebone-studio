OptiNiSt - 
===================================

OptiNiSt(Optical Neuroimage Studio) that helps researchers to try multiple data analysis methods, to visualize the results, and to construct data analysis pipelines. Data formats follow NWB standard.


OpitNiSt will allow not only neural data experts but also non-experts to try advanced analysis methods by combining neuroimage and behavioral data.
It will help functional data analysis and pipeline building first by Brain/MINDS researchers but also by neuroscientists and data scientists world wide.
Availability of not only data but also the tool for analysis on Brian/MINDS Data Portal will facilitate wider usage of marmoset functional brain data.
OptiNiSt will also help reproducibility of research, standardization of analysis protocols, and developments of novel analysis tools as plug-in.
