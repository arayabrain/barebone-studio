## 3. IPython notebooks

OptiNiSt provides several ipynb notebooks in the notebooks folder: caiman.ipynb, suite2p.ipynb, lccd.ipynb. These may be used for assessing where in the code

### Parameter conversion notebook
In the upgrade to OptiNiSt version 2, the parameter input structure was reorganised. Workflows created in  OptiNiSt version 1 and reproduced in version 2, as well as [workflow.yaml](ImportWorkflowYaml) produced and saved in version 1 and imported in version 2, will not work.

To reproduce a version 1 Workflow, a conversion script is provided, in the form of a IPython notebook. Follow this procedure:
1. Download workflow from Record tab
2. Open notebooks/yaml-converter.ipynb
3. Setup environment following instructions at the top of yaml-converter.ipynb
4. Convert files using the section at the bottom of yaml-converter.ipynb
```python
input_file = ".yaml"
output_file = ".yaml" # any name you want
convert_workflow_file(input_file, output_file)
```
