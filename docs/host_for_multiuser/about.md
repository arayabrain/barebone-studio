=====

- Normally, Optinist is a single user application. But you can host it yourself for multiuser use.
  - We call single user mode as `standalone`, and multiuser mode as `multiuser`.
- In `multiuser` mode, we provide the following features.
  - Account management
    - Using mysql(or mariadb) database.
  - Authentication
    - Using Firebase Authentication. Google account is required to create your firebase project.
    - Currently, only email/password authentication is supported.
  - Data management
  - Data sharing
