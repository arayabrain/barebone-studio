Ain: null # possibility to seed with predetermined binary masks
thr: 0.9
p: 1 # order of the autoregressive system
K: 4 # upper bound on number of components per patch, in general None
gSig: [3, 3] # gaussian width of a 2D gaussian kernel, which approximates a neuron
gSiz: [13, 13] # average diameter of a neuron, in general 4*gSig+1
merge_thr: .7 # merging threshold, max correlation allowed
# rf: 40 # half-size of the patches in pixels. e.g., if rf=40, patches are 80x80
stride_cnmf: 20 # amount of overlap between the patches in pixels
#                     (keep it at least large as gSiz, i.e 4 times the neuron size gSig)
tsub: 2 # downsampling factor in time for initialization,

#                     increase if you have memory problems
#                     you can pass them here as boolean vectors
low_rank_background: null # None leaves background of each patch intact,
#                     True performs global low-rank approximation if gnb>0
gnb: 0 # number of background components (rank) if positive,

#                         gnb= 0: Return background as b and W
